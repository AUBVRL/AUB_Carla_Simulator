# AUB_Carla_Simulator
This is a code that is taken from the Carla Simualtor and heavily defined to fit our own research.

The three different files present are just part of the entire Carla Code, so here are the corresponding locations that they belong to:

1. examples: Calra -> PythonAPI -> examples
2. rpc: Calra -> LibCarla -> source -> carla -> rpc
3. trafficmanager: Calra -> LibCarla -> source -> carla -> trafficmanager
